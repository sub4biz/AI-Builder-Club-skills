# AI Builder Club — Skills

A Claude Code **plugin marketplace** of the skills we share at
[AI Builder Club](https://www.aibuilderclub.com/lp/loop-engineer?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=aibc-skills)
for building **loop engineers**: agents that get triggered on their own, pick up work, ship it,
verify it, and log what they learned, so the work compounds without you prompting every step.
It's the productized version of the setup my team runs in production.

Two flagship skill sets (more to come):

- **Codebase harness** — make any repo agent-ready (run, test, verify, ship — including an
  isolated cloud box per agent so loops ship code in *parallel*).
- **Loops** — spin up compounding agent loops on a shared, file-based knowledge base.

Plus standalone utility skills:

- **[agent-context-audit](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/agent-context-audit/SKILL.md)** — audit your agent context (CLAUDE.md, codebase docs, skills,
  tool/MCP designs) against Anthropic's Claude 5 context-engineering guidance — finds
  overconstraint, conflicting instructions, redundancy, stale facts, and missing gotchas;
  reports findings with concrete rewrites, then applies approved fixes.
- **[Open agent teams](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/open-agent-teams/SKILL.md)** — delegate tasks to *any* CLI agent (claude, codex, grok, aider, …)
  running in a detached tmux session, with a race-safe done-signal protocol, multi-turn
  iteration, and a CLAUDE.md delegation-rules template (coordinator/executor roles).
- **[SEO growth](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/seo-growth/SKILL.md)** — where to point SEO effort, as two playbooks: a **cold start** with no
  rankings and no authority, and an **existing site with data**. Distilled from two content
  properties we run in production — including the emerging-term method that took a brand-new
  pillar page to the site's #1 clicked page in 7 days, and the failures that cost us a head
  term. Ships a loop template so it can run on a schedule.
- **[Visual flow GIF](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/visual-flow-gif/SKILL.md)** — turn an article, workflow, or architecture into a static PNG +
  animated GIF flow diagram (JSON spec → local Python/Pillow renderer).
- **[Karaoke captions](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/karaoke-captions/SKILL.md)** — burn word-level highlight captions into a video
  (MLX Whisper → ASS → FFmpeg libass).

## Loop engineer & Codebase harness

The shift: you stop prompting a coding agent task-by-task, and start **designing loops**.

A loop is an agent that wakes up on a trigger (a cron, a webhook, an incident, another agent),
does some investigation and work, and writes what it found and did into a shared, file-based
memory. Next run it reads that memory and keeps going. The real power is **compounding**: many
loops (support, SEO, product, ads) read and write the *same* folders, so a friction the support
loop logs can get picked up by the product loop, and a keyword the ads loop finds can feed the
SEO loop. One shared brain, many loops.

Building one comes down to four ingredients:

1. **Triggers:** cron, webhook, an incident, or another agent wakes the loop at the right time.
2. **A file + logging structure:** the shared memory loops read and write → the **`loops`** skills.
3. **Tools & connectors:** so the agent can do real work (your skills/MCPs).
4. **A codebase harness:** so the agent can run, test, and verify its own work → the
   **`codebase-harness`** skills.

This single **`skills`** plugin ships both sets — giving you **#2 and #4**, plus the
scaffolding to add the rest.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add AI-Builder-Club/skills
/plugin install skills@ai-builder-club
```
One plugin, all the skills below.

## The two entry points

### `/setup-codebase-harness` — make a code repo agent-ready
Run it in the code repo your agents work in, so they can run, test, and verify their own work.
It orchestrates the harness skills below — pull in only what the repo needs.

### `/new-loop` — build your shared brain
Run it where your agent's memory should live. First run **bootstraps the knowledge base**
(creates `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LOG.md`, the `signals/ docs/ domains/` folders, and a knowledge-base
section in your `CLAUDE.md`); then it scaffolds the loop, does one real test run, and logs it.
Run it again any time to add another loop.

## The skills (when to use which)

**Codebase harness** — make a repo agent-ready

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`setup-codebase-harness`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/setup-codebase-harness/SKILL.md)** | Onboarding a repo to agent-driven dev — the master that orchestrates the four below. |
| **[`dev-local-setup`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/dev-local-setup/SKILL.md)** | You need a one-command local dev stack (`scripts/dev-local.sh up`). |
| **[`e2e-setup`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/e2e-setup/SKILL.md)** | The repo has no (or weak) e2e — add a real per-PR test gate. |
| **[`crabbox-setup`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/crabbox-setup/SKILL.md)** | Loops ship code **in parallel** — give each agent its own isolated **cloud** stack (one laptop can't run N). The cloud counterpart to dev-local. |
| **[`verifier-setup`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/verifier-setup/SKILL.md)** | Make a repo's work verifiable — scaffolds a repo-specific **`/verify`** skill (a fresh sub-agent drives the app, captures screenshot/video proof, opens the PR with it embedded). Ensures dev-local + the browser driver exist first. |

**Loops** — the shared knowledge base

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`new-loop`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/new-loop/SKILL.md)** | You want a new loop/workstream the agent owns (bootstraps the knowledge base on first run). |

**Visuals** — turn source material into diagrams

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`visual-flow-gif`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/visual-flow-gif/SKILL.md)** | You want an article, workflow, or architecture turned into a static PNG + animated GIF flow diagram (JSON spec → Python/Pillow renderer). |

**Video** — burn karaoke-style captions into a video

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`karaoke-captions`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/karaoke-captions/SKILL.md)** | You want word-level highlight captions burned into a video. |

**Context** — keep your agent context sharp

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`agent-context-audit`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/agent-context-audit/SKILL.md)** | Auditing a repo's agent context (CLAUDE.md, docs, skills, tool/MCP designs) against Anthropic's Claude 5 context-engineering guidance — finds overconstraint, conflicts, redundancy, stale facts, and missing gotchas; reports findings with rewrites, then applies approved fixes. |

**Delegation** — run other agents as executors

| Skill | Use it when… |
|---|---|
| **[`open-agent-teams`](https://github.com/AI-Builder-Club/skills/blob/main/skills/open-agent-teams/SKILL.md)** | You want to delegate work to any CLI agent (claude, codex, grok, pi, opencode) in an observable, detached tmux session — start, wait, iterate, and stop via the bundled `tdel` helper. Ships a `CLAUDE.md` delegation-rules template (coordinator vs executor) in `references/`. |

After setup, each session the agent reads `CLAUDE.md` + the relevant domain README, does work,
writes artifacts, and appends to `LOG.md`. For code changes it works in an isolated worktree and verifies via `/verify` before shipping.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (the skills assume it).
- `git`. That's the only hard dependency for the knowledge base + harness.
- The harness skills want the code repo they ship into to be a git repo with a working build/test
  setup. They use Codex for review if available, and degrade gracefully if not.
- `crabbox-setup` (optional, for parallel cloud boxes) needs the `crabbox` CLI + a provider
  (Daytona: `daytona` CLI / `DAYTONA_API_KEY`).
- `open-agent-teams` needs `tmux`, plus whichever CLI agents you delegate to on your PATH
  (claude, codex, grok, pi, opencode, …).
- `karaoke-captions` (optional) needs macOS Apple Silicon, Python 3.10+, and FFmpeg with `libass`.
